  <h1>Criteria</h1>
<p>This is the criteria that will be used when critiquing all of the horror films. I have taken this info from <a href="https://custom-writing.org/blog/how-to-write-a-movie-critique-top-tips">this site</a>. The main points focus around the plot, structure, characters, dialogues, and scenes of the film. I will use these points to grade individually and then come to an overall score. Another important aspect for these movies is whether they are good enough to watch again, so I will be adding that as a separate thing as even an arguably bad film may still be worth rewatching.</p>
<h2>How to Critique a Film’s Plot</h2>
<p>The plot is the flow of events and actions that consequently develop in a story. To discuss the film’s plot in your movie critique, you need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide whether the plot is predictable.</li>
<li>Define whether some actions were unpredictable.</li>
<li>If they were, express your views considering an unexpected turn of events that shocked you.</li>
<li>See if the story corresponds to the characters’ motivations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Critique a Film’s Structure</h2>
<p>The movie’s structure is how the parts relate to each other or how the plot is built. Remember that the structure encompasses the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposition (introducing the key characters and their circumstances)</li>
<li>Rising action (mounting tension that leads to the story’s climax)</li>
<li>Climax</li>
<li>Falling action</li>
<li>Denouement (a resolution that brings the story to an end)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Critique the Movie’s Characters</h2>
<p>Characterization is the description of the characters’ personalities, beliefs, motivations, etc. To discuss the film’s characterization in your movie critique, you need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concentrate on specific movie characters.</li>
<li>Set your priorities: some movie characters do not need any serious analysis.</li>
<li>See if the characters’ dress, talk, act, or look corresponds with the impression they should create.</li>
<li>Remember that the better the characters are developed, the more character-driven the story is.</li>
<li>Consider that the right motivation of the characters makes the audience believe the story.</li>
<li>Remember that good dialogues should not be protracted as they are to sound natural.</li>
<li>See if there is a logical development of the conversation.</li>
<li>Watch the body language of the actors and decide whether their gestures correspond to their words or not.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Criticize the Movie’s Scenes</h2>
<p>A scene is a self-contained episode within a larger work. To discuss the scenes in your movie critique, you should do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine whether the scenes were well-played by the actors and well-shot by the operator.</li>
<li>Mind that they are to develop smoothly as a part of a larger dramatic unit.</li>
<li>Remember that scenes should build a chain that makes up the story.</li>
<li>Examine if they contain some conflict and how the characters typically react to it.</li>
<li>Try to follow through each scene to make sure that it properly transitioned into the next one.</li>
</ul>
