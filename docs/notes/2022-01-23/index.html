  <p>Players: Squiggy, Ricey, Waifu, and Ziggo</p>
<h3>Interview with Headmaster and Police:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The headmaster and a police officer were both waiting for us outside of the building after we were able to escape.</li>
<li>They wanted to ask us what happened, it was clear based on where and when we left that we were suspicious.</li>
<li>Corey slow rolled, did not give them any info about what really happened.</li>
<li>Doctor Mack came and got us, asking us to follow him to his office.</li>
<li>Doctor Mack also noticed Lilly looking very interested at the conversation and invited her as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Talk with Doctor Mack:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Believes something big is going to happen soon<ul>
<li>Showed us a news paper clipping about a forest fire<ul>
<li>Corey deduced the paper clipping was from June 1947-1950</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Believes the convergence between the lines of events is right at Pinebox</li>
<li>Not only are weird things happening, they are speeding up.<ul>
<li>At best 2 years, another event like the burn will happen.<ul>
<li>Only this time, maybe it will be worse. Reoccurring things seem to increase in magnitude.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Believes we should figure out how to make the lay lines not touch.<ul>
<li>Does not know how to do this.</li>
<li>Rolled for occult, we do not know either. We have studied lay lines, but usually crossing lines lead to harmless effects.<ul>
<li>The worst one we know about is the Bermuda triangle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Going to the chemistry lab:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Got to the lab, the door is locked and there is a phone.<ul>
<li>Trying the phone seems like it’s waiting input, no one there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Someone opened the door for us, saying that the card reader is always broken.</li>
<li>Looked around trying to find Missy<ul>
<li>Was able to get someone to say where they work, structural chemistry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conversation with Missy regarding stalking<ul>
<li>Asked for Corey and Nathaniel to leave</li>
<li>Stated that talking about the stalker before caused a male friend to get attacked</li>
<li>Johnny Chafe, studies biochemistry<ul>
<li>Keeps coming back and asking her out</li>
<li>Friend, Robert, got attacked likely for talking to her.<ul>
<li>Genetically modified African bees</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Works on the second floor</li>
<li>Has to come to third floor and uses the imaging machine and looks for her</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talking to Johnny Chafe:<ul>
<li>Lilly tried to enter into lab that he is in, pissed off the head professor for the lab. Could not get to talk to him.</li>
<li>Kim also tries, gives the can of bug spray to someone, and then almost does not get it back. They ultimately throw it outside the lab. Kim attacks them.<ul>
<li>It was pretty apparent that they were calling security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We are able to escape the building without getting captures by security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talk to Missy 2.0:<ul>
<li>Corey goes back into the building to talk to Missy to ask that she contacts Johnny to set up a meeting.</li>
<li>Missy agrees to set it up</li>
<li>Corey also gets her phone number so that we can communicate with her later.</li>
<li>Johnny bumps into Corey and spills a substance on his clothes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Talking outside / Bug fight:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Corey came outside and updated the group.</li>
<li>A swarm of cockroaches can be heard swarming</li>
<li>Corey takes his clothes off and throws them, making the roaches swarm the clothes and leave us alone.</li>
</ul>
