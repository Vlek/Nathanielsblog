<h3>Interview with Headmaster and Police:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The headmaster and a police officer were both waiting for us outside of the building after we were able to escape.</li>
<li>They wanted to ask us what happened, it was clear based on where and when we left that we were suspicious.</li>
<li>Corey slow rolled, did not give them any info about what really happened.</li>
<li>Doctor Mack came and got us, asking us to follow him to his office.</li>
<li>Doctor Mack also noticed Lilly looking very interested at the conversation and invited her as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Talk with Doctor Mack:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Believes something big is going to happen soon<ul>
<li>Showed us a news paper clipping about a forest fire<ul>
<li>Corey deduced the paper clipping was from June 1947-1950</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Believes the convergence between the lines of events is right at Pinebox</li>
<li>Not only are weird things happening, they are speeding up.<ul>
<li>At best 2 years, another event like the burn will happen.<ul>
<li>Only this time, maybe it will be worse. Reoccurring things seem to increase in magnitude.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Believes we should figure out how to make the lay lines not touch.<ul>
<li>Does not know how to do this.</li>
<li>Rolled for occult, we do not know either. We have studied lay lines, but usually crossing lines lead to harmless effects.<ul>
<li>The worst one we know about is the Bermuda triangle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Going to the chemistry lab:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Got to the lab, the door is locked and there is a phone.<ul>
<li>Trying the phone seems like it’s waiting input, no one there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Someone opened the door for us, saying that the card reader is always broken.</li>
<li>Looked around trying to find Missy<ul>
<li>Was able to get someone to say where they work, structural chemistry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conversation with Missy regarding stalking<ul>
<li>Asked for Corey and Nathaniel to leave</li>
<li>Stated that talking about the stalker before caused a male friend to get attacked</li>
<li>Johnny Chafe, studies biochemistry<ul>
<li>Keeps coming back and asking her out</li>
<li>Friend, Robert, got attacked likely for talking to her.<ul>
<li>Genetically modified African bees</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Works on the second floor</li>
<li>Has to come to third floor and uses the imaging machine and looks for her</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talking to Johnny Chafe:<ul>
<li>Lilly tried to enter into lab that he is in, pissed off the head professor for the lab. Could not get to talk to him.</li>
<li>Kim also tries, gives the can of bug spray to someone, and then almost does not get it back. They ultimately throw it outside the lab. Kim attacks them.<ul>
<li>It was pretty apparent that they were calling security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We are able to escape the building without getting captures by security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talk to Missy 2.0:<ul>
<li>Corey goes back into the building to talk to Missy to ask that she contacts Johnny to set up a meeting.</li>
<li>Missy agrees to set it up</li>
<li>Corey also gets her phone number so that we can communicate with her later.</li>
<li>Johnny bumps into Corey and spills a substance on his clothes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Talking outside / Bug fight:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Corey came outside and updated the group.</li>
<li>A swarm of cockroaches can be heard swarming</li>
<li>Corey takes his clothes off and throws them, making the roaches swarm the clothes and leave us alone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Start in the cafeteria:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We all started in the cafeteria, trying to figure out where we would sit:<ul>
<li>Nathaniel sat with a potential drug dealer</li>
<li>Corey sat with ladies to try to talk them up</li>
<li>Kim sat with as many white people as she could</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meet with senior student in gym basement:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Was told by the student that there are things that happen at the university and to mind your own business to survive.</li>
<li>States that students are going missing, specifically nerds.</li>
<li>The group then hears a sound in the hallway that sounds suspicious</li>
<li>The group then goes to investigate</li>
</ul>
<h3>Investigating the noise:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Commotion the corridor causes the team to loose where the sound came from.</li>
<li>A security guard was present that informs the crew that a camera that was monitoring the hallway had been smashed</li>
<li>A professor came to talk to the security guard regarding the camera<ul>
<li>During this conversation, Kim attempted to steal the camera and successfully did so.</li>
<li>Returned it right away</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another sound was heard</li>
</ul>
<h3>Boiler room:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Muaddib420’s character entered the boiler room to encounter a seductive woman with tattoos.</li>
<li>The woman stated that everyone would burn, grabbed a hold of him, and where she grabbed started to burn.</li>
<li>Got out of there quickly</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nathaniel’s sidetrack:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nathaniel’s ghost protector was urging him to go outside.</li>
<li>So the team did and he started smoking</li>
<li>The janitor outside told Nathaniel to put out the joint and complained about graffiti inside the gym that he had to remove.</li>
<li>The team realized that the reason was because there was danger in the gym that they just left.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dealing with the occult runes issue in the gym:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In hearing the janitor mention graffiti and what was happening, it was enough for Nathaniel to remember a forum post that he read regarding rituals with runes etched in a specific pattern to cause the same sort of fire that they were seeing.</li>
<li>The team separated to handle the runes after syncing on where.</li>
<li>Nathaniel got to the first rune place and found that it was runes for numbers and they had to be extinguished in a specific pattern and did so.</li>
<li>After waiting some time, it was apparent that the other group needed help.</li>
<li>The other group rushed to the rune and had a hard time figuring out what to do.</li>
<li>The security guard that they had seen before became hostile and it was made clear that they were the ones that carved the runes into the walls. In order to deal with them, they were knocked out and hog tied.</li>
<li>Kim insanely but ingeniously decided to chip the whole damn rune off of the wall with their knife, causing multiple runes to stop glowing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Needler shows up</h3>
<ul>
<li>As the team was finishing the last runes, The Needler appeared.</li>
<li>The Needler was not happy regarding the failure of the security guard to do their bidding and threw a syringe at them which missed.</li>
<li>Once that happened, they blinked out of existence.</li>
</ul>
