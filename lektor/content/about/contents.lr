title: About this Website

body:


This is a fan-made website that tries to be period accurate to 2007 for the Eastern Texas University Savage World campaign.

I have used Lektor for generating the website and used period accurage sources and design as best as I could other than the fact that I am using modern tooling to get the job done as having HTML without CSS or JavaScript is very painful to do, especially since I am doing this as a hobby and I would rather spend the time creating content.
